This is the lighting control software for Joule the art car.  This is the second version of the software, initially completed for Burning Man 2017.

It is based on the LX Studio framework: https://lx.studio

Project files for development in Eclipse are included in the repository.

Joule is a product of the Idaho Burners' Alliance and was built at their main shop facility, Xanadu, in Boise Idaho.
